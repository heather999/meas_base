"""Base classes for forced measurement plugins and the driver task for these.

In forced measurement, a reference catalog is used to define restricted measurements
(usually just fluxes) on an image.  As the reference catalog may be deeper than the
detection limit of the measurement image, we do not assume that we can use detection and
deblend information from the measurement image.  Instead, we assume this information is
present in the reference catalog and can be "transformed" in some sense to the
measurement frame.  At the very least, this means that Footprints from the reference
catalog should be transformed and installed as Footprints in the output measurement
catalog.  If we have a procedure that can transform HeavyFootprints, we can then proceed
with measurement as usual, but using the reference catalog's id and parent fields to
define deblend families.  If this transformation does not preserve HeavyFootprints (this
is currently the case, at least for CCD forced photometry), then we will only be able to
replace objects with noise one deblend family at a time, and hence measurements run in
single-object mode may be contaminated by neighbors when run on objects with parent != 0.

Measurements are generally recorded in the coordinate system of the image being measured
(and all slot-eligible fields must be), but non-slot fields may be recorded in other
coordinate systems if necessary to avoid information loss (this should, of course, be
indicated in the field documentation).  Note that the reference catalog may be in a
different coordinate system; it is the responsibility of plugins to transform the data
they need themselves, using the reference WCS provided.  However, for plugins that only
require a position or shape, they may simply use output
`~lsst.afw.table.SourceCatalog`\'s centroid or shape slots, which will generally be set
to the transformed position of the reference object before any other plugins are run, and
hence avoid using the reference catalog at all.

Command-line driver tasks for forced measurement can be found in
`lsst.meas.base.forcedPhotImage`, including
`~lsst.meas.base.forcedPhotImage.ForcedPhotImageTask`,
`~lsst.meas.base.forcedPhotImage.ForcedPhotCcdTask`, and
`~lsst.meas.base.forcedPhotImage.ForcedPhotCoaddTask`.

        `None`.
    kwds :
        Keyword arguments are passed to the supertask constructor.

    Notes
    -----
    The task is configured with a list of "plugins": each plugin defines the
    values it measures (i.e. the columns in a table it will fill) and conducts
    that measurement on each detected source (see ForcedPlugin).  The job of
    the measurement task is to initialize the set of plugins (which includes
    setting up the catalog schema) from their configuration, and then invoke
    each plugin on each source.

    Most of the time, `ForcedMeasurementTask` will be used via one of the
    subclasses of `~lsst.meas.base.forcedPhotImage.ForcedPhotImageTask`:
    `~lsst.meas.base.forcedPhotCcd.ForcedPhotCcdTask` or
    `~lsst.meas.base.forcedPhotCoadd.ForcedPhotCoaddTask`. These combine this
    measurement subtask with a "references" subtask (see
    `lsst.meas.base.references.BaseReferencesTask` and
    `~lsst.meas.base.references.CoaddSrcReferencesTask`) to perform forced
    measurement using measurements performed on another image as the
    references.  There is generally little reason to use
    `ForcedMeasurementTask` outside of one of these drivers, unless it is
    necessary to avoid using the Butler for I/O.

    Forced measurement means that the plugins are provided with a reference
    source containing centroid and/or shape measurements that they may use
    however they see fit. Some plugins can use these to set the location and
    size of apertures, but others may choose to ignore this information,
    essentially performing an unforced measurement starting at the position of
    the reference source (which may nevertheless be useful for certain
    investigations). Knowing how the plugin uses the reference information is
    essential to interpreting its resulting measurements. Typically, centroid
    and shape measurement plugins (e.g., ``SdssCentroid`` and ``SdssShape``)
    are performing unforced measurements.

    Note that while `lsst.meas.base.sfm.SingleFrameMeasurementTask` is passed
    an initial `~lsst.afw.table.Schema` that is appended to in order to create
    the output `~lsst.afw.table.Schema`, `ForcedMeasurementTask` is
    initialized with the `~lsst.afw.table.Schema` of the reference catalog,
    from which a new `~lsst.afw.table.Schema` for the output catalog is
    created.  Fields to be copied directly from the reference
    `~lsst.afw.table.Schema` are added before ``Plugin`` fields are added.

        - `generateMeasCat` must be called to create the output ``measCat``
          argument.
        - `~lsst.afw.detection.Footprint`\s appropriate for the forced sources
          must be attached to the ``measCat`` records. The
          ``attachTransformedFootprints`` method can be used to do this, but
          this degrades “Heavy” `~lsst.afw.detection.Footprint`s to regular
          `~lsst.afw.detection.Footprint`\s, leading to non-deblended
          measurement, so most callers should provide
          `~lsst.afw.detection.Footprint`\s some other way. Typically,
          calling code will have access to information that will allow them to

          `~lsst.meas.base.forcedPhotCoadd.ForcedPhotCoaddTask` uses the
          ``HeavyFootprint``\s from deblending run in the same band just before

        Notes
        -----
        `~lsst.afw.detection.Footprint`\s for forced photometry must be in the
        pixel coordinate system of the image being measured, while the actual
        detections may start out in a different coordinate system. This
        default implementation transforms the Footprints from the reference
        catalog from the WCS to the exposure's WCS, which downgrades
        ``HeavyFootprint``\s into regular `~lsst.afw.detection.Footprint`\s,
        destroying deblend information.

        Note that `~lsst.meas.base.forcedPhotImage.ForcedPhotImageTask`
        delegates to this method in its own
        `~lsst.meas.base.forcedPhotImage.ForcedPhotImageTask.attachFootprints`
        method.  This method can be overridden by its subclasses to define how
        their `~lsst.afw.detection.Footprint`\s should be generated.

        See the documentation for `run` for information about the
        relationships between `run`, `generateMeasCat`, and
        `attachTransformedFootprints`.
