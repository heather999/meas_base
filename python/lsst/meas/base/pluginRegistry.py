        Parameters
        ----------
        name : `str`
            The name of plugin class. This is used as a prefix for all fields
            produced by the plugin, and it should generally contain the name
            of the plugin or algorithm class itself as well as enough of the
            namespace to make it clear where to find the code.  For example
            ``base_GaussianFlux`` indicates an algorithm in `lsst.meas.base`
            that measures Gaussian Flux and produces fields such as
            ``base_GaussianFlux_instFlux``, ``base_GaussianFlux_instFluxErr``
            and ``base_GaussianFlux_flag``.
        shouldApCorr : `bool`

            be aperture corrected. This is shorthand for ``apCorrList=[name]``
            and is ignored if ``apCorrList`` is specified.
        apCorrList : `list` of `str`
            List of field name prefixes for instFlux fields to be aperture
            corrected.  If an algorithm produces a single instFlux that should
            be aperture corrected then it is simpler to set
            ``shouldApCorr=True``. But if an algorithm produces multiple such
            fields then it must specify ``apCorrList`` instead. For example,
            ``modelfit_CModel`` produces three such fields:
            ``apCorrList=("modelfit_CModel_exp", "modelfit_CModel_exp",
            "modelfit_CModel_def")``. If ``apCorrList`` is not empty then
