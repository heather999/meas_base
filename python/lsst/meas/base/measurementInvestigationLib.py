    Given a measurement catalog and the exposure on which the measurements

    Parameters
    ----------

        The image on which measurements were made.

    measCat : `lsst.afw.table.SourceCatalog`

        deterministic noise.

    """Create a catalog prepopulated with IDs.

    This function is used to generate a `~lsst.afw.table.SourceCatalog`
    containing blank records with IDs as specified in the ``idList``
    parameter.

    This function is primarily used when re-running measurements on a
    particular footprint. Specifying IDs in the new measurement catalog which
    correspond to IDs in the old catalog makes comparing results much easier.

    The ``resetParents`` and ``addParents`` options are needed because
    `lsst.meas.base.SingleFrameMeasurementTask.runPlugins` will skip child
    objects whose parents are not in the catalog.

    Parameters
    ----------
    schema : `lsst.afw.table.Schema`
        Schema used to describe the fields in the resulting catalog.

    oldCatalog : `lsst.afw.table.SourceCatalog`
        Catalog containing previous measurements.

    idList : iterable of `int`
        Iterable whose values should be numbers corresponding to measurement
        IDs which exist in ``oldCatalog``.

    fields : iterable of `str`
        Iterable whose entries should be strings corresponding to schema keys
        that exist in both the old catalog and input schema. Fields listed
        will be copied from the old catalog into the new catalog.

    resetParents : `bool`
        If ``True``, child objects whose parents are not in the ``idList``
        will have their parents reset to zero.

    addParents : `bool`
        If ``True``, parents of child objects will be added to ``idList`` if
        they are not already present.

    Returns
    -------
    measCat : `lsst.afw.table.SourceCatalog`
        Catalog prepopulated with entries with the IDs specified.
